## Optimizations

- Completely new code from the old one
- Implemented eslint, editorconfig, and prettier, for finding errors and consistent code style
- Integrated webpack
- Changed the UI
- Made variables, functions, etc easier to read (hopefully, need to work on my naming)

## Lessons Learned

Making use of the single responsibility principle. I learned how to spot code duplications, which was what I struggled the most with all the projects I've done so far. I'm still not fully confident but I will keep learning more about this.
